# UniversalAPI
Integrated Common platform for Multiple Cloud API

Cloud computing emerged and acquired huge popularity. Many Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like, AWS, Rackspace, Azure and many more are facilitating clients with common services (storage, computing, networking,  etc.) and thriving for more client by adding new features. So, Cloud Consumer (CC) falls under critical situation to adapt new API and quickly switch to CSP that best suits their business requirement. To solve this perplexity of CC, we introduce a prototype which integrates different Cloud API to an abstract API platform and developed a Proof of concept (PoC) for our platform. Using our single point API CC can quickly switch and get facilitated with the services of different CSP without individual API knowledge.
